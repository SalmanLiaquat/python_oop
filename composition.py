#Composition

#-ðŸ‘‰ Composition is a strong "has-a" relationship.
#-It means one class owns another class, and the part cannot exist without the whole.
#-The lifetime of the part depends entirely on the whole.
#-If the container is destroyed, all its parts are also destroyed.
#âœ… Real-world example:
#->A House has Rooms.
#->Rooms cannot exist independently of a house.
#->If the house is destroyed, the rooms are destroyed too.
